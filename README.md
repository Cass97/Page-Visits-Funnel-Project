# Page-Visits-Funnel-Project
This was an off-platform project as part of the Multiple Tables in Pandas module in the Codecademy Data Science course. It was used for practical learning of Pandas. It demonstrates an understanding of Pandas in the following areas: creating and modifying dataframes, aggregate functions, multiple tables.
This is intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
